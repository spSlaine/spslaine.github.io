Iâ€™ve been messing around with a ChevronBar to display progress through a workflow or wizard.

The first version was based on CSS and sprites, but I want a way of easily changing the colours of the steps. I based the following on https://github.com/twslankard/css-chevron-bar.

There is a bit of messing around when the font changes , but itâ€™s a good start ðŸ™‚
